5. **What is the difference between class and ID selectors?**
   - A class selector is denoted with a dot (`.`) and can be applied to multiple elements, while an ID selector is denoted with a hash (`#`) and should be unique within a page.

### Intermediate CSS Questions

6. **What is the box model in CSS?**
   - The box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements in the document tree, consisting of margins, borders, padding, and the actual content area.

7. **What are CSS pseudo-classes?**
   - Pseudo-classes are special states of an element, defined with a colon, like `:hover`, `:focus`, and `:nth-child()`.

8. **What are CSS pseudo-elements?**

12. **What is the difference between `absolute`, `relative`, `fixed`, and `sticky` positioning?**
    - `Relative` positions an element relative to its normal position. `Absolute` positions it relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. `Fixed` positions it relative to the viewport, and `sticky` is a hybrid of relative and fixed, toggling between them based on scroll position.

13. **What is the purpose of media queries?**

19. **What is the difference between `inline`, `block`, and `inline-block`?**
    - `Block` elements take up the full width, `inline` elements take only the necessary width, and `inline-block` elements allow for width and height while remaining inline.

20. **What is the `overflow` property?**
    - The `overflow` property controls what happens when content overflows its box (visible, hidden, scroll, or auto).
